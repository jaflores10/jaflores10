👋 Hi, I'm Javier Flores.

💼 I work primarily as a Data Engineer and help with product management, currently working in the marketing and advertisting tech industry.

🧑‍💻 I'm interested in building data products that optimize workflows, enhance data-driven decision-making, and make the day-to-day responsibilities of those around me a bit easier. My work typically focuses on automating data deliverables (reporting & insights, machine learning training data, etc.), performing ad-hoc analyses for clients, and developing new features for data products. The tools/technologies I primarily use are SQL, Python, Tableau, GCP, AWS, and various marketing platforms.

🔭 I’m currently working on implementing more modular data transformations to ensure clients and internal teams have clean, accurate, and complete data.

⚡ In my spare time, I enjoy getting outdoors with my dog 🐶, surfing 🏄, snowboarding 🏂, skateboarding 🛹, and finding new recipes to cook 👨‍🍳.
